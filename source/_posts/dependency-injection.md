As a developer, we write code day by day, try to handle many things, put all the thing in the right way it should be. Almost of our time is spend to googling usage of some libralies ( or frameworks ) , try to handle some inceribale bugs or try to maintain some shity things from another guys you may never ever met. All this mess made us forget about something that really have a meaning, it made us forget that our job is not just try to handle all the things but our job is focus to create the "new" thing depen on another guy achievement. But the reason why we are so confused lies in our purpose. Just like the picture bellow, sometime you relize yourself that you are just a noob and trying to handle all that mess.
